# JavaScript

This project aims to create an ERC20 token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities for minting new tokens and burning existing tokens, along with maintaining balances for token holders.

# Description

This Solidity program implements a simple voting contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to vote for candidates and provides functionalities to manage the voting process.

# To run the program

contract MyToken {
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint public totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint _totalSupply) {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        totalSupply = _totalSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = _totalSupply;
    }

Visit the Remix IDE website (https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a new file for your Solidity code.

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in Remix.
Ensure the correct compiler version is selected.
Click "Compile" to compile your Solidity code. Make sure there are no compilation errors.
Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix.
Select the contract you want to deploy from the dropdown (assuming you have only one contract in your file).
Enter the constructor arguments (e.g., token name, symbol, total supply).
Choose an Ethereum account (e.g., MetaMask) to deploy the contract from.
Click "Deploy" to deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
